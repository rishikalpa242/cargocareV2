# Container Status & Tracking Migration Summary

## Changes Made

✅ **Removed Container Status & Tracking from Liner Bookings**

The Container Status & Tracking functionality has been moved from Liner Bookings to Shipment Plans where it logically belongs.

### Files Modified:

#### 1. `app/routes/liner-bookings.$id.edit.tsx`
- ❌ Removed entire "Container Status & Tracking" form section
- ❌ Removed container tracking fields from action handler
- ❌ Removed tracking state from openSections
- ❌ Removed container fields from linerBookingData object

#### 2. `app/routes/liner-bookings.new.tsx`
- ❌ Removed entire "Container Status & Tracking" accordion section
- ❌ Removed container tracking fields from action handler
- ❌ Removed tracking state from openSections
- ❌ Removed container fields from linerBookingData object

### What This Achieves:

#### **Liner Bookings** now focuses on:
- ✅ Carrier booking details and status
- ✅ Vessel and scheduling information
- ✅ Booking numbers and carrier communications
- ✅ Linking to shipment plans

#### **Shipment Plans** now owns:
- ✅ Container Status & Tracking (already implemented)
- ✅ Container movement lifecycle
- ✅ Physical container operations
- ✅ Loading, gating, and shipping status
- ✅ Updated status options: Pending, Container Stuffing Completed, Empty Container Picked Up, Gated In, Loaded on Board

## Logical Separation

This change creates a clear separation of concerns:

### Liner Bookings 📋
**Purpose**: Managing bookings with carriers/liners
- Carrier booking status
- Vessel assignments
- Booking confirmations
- Documentation from carriers

### Shipment Plans 📦
**Purpose**: Managing actual shipment execution
- Container tracking and status
- Physical container operations
- Loading and discharge operations
- Real-time shipment progress

## Benefits

1. **Clear Responsibility**: Each module handles its specific domain
2. **Better User Experience**: Users know where to find container tracking information
3. **Data Integrity**: Container status is managed in one place
4. **Logical Workflow**: Book with carrier → Track in shipment plan
5. **Reduced Duplication**: No conflicting container status information

## Migration Complete ✅

Container Status & Tracking is now properly located only in **Shipment Plans** where it belongs conceptually and operationally.
